      <h2>Modern Web Deisgn</h2>
      <p>Modern web design consists of 3 major front-end languages, HTML,CSS and <br>
        JavaScript. HTML creates the structure for the project, such as the text <br>
        on the screen or links you can click on. CSS makes HTML look good, and makes <br>
        your website unique. JavaScript adds logic to your website, which could mean <br>
        saving form data, links you to another page when you click a button, or <br>
        anything that can't be done in HTML.<p>
      <h2>The Terminal</h2>
      <p>The terminal gives you direct access to your computer, with no software needed.</p>
      <h2>GitHub</h2>
      <p>GitHub is a place where Git repo's can be viewed easily. GitHub makes it <br>
        easy to share code or work on projects together with a team, or keep a copy <br>
        of your personal project on the cloud.</p>
      <h2>Markdown</h2>
      <p>Markdown is plain-text file which gives you formatting options, including bold, <br>
        italics, headers and more. It is useful for sites like GitHub, where they can be easily viewed.</p>
