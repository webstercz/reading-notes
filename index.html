      <h2>Modern Web Deisng</h2>
      <p>Modern web design consists of 3 major front-end languages, HTML,CSS and 
        JavaScript. HTML creates the structure for the project, such as the text 
        on the screen or links you can click on. CSS makes HTML look good, and makes 
        your website unique. JavaScript adds logic to your website, which could mean 
        saving form data, links you to another page when you click a button, or 
        anything that can't be done in HTML.<p>
      <h2>The Terminal</h2>
      <p>The terminal gives you direct access to your computer, with no software needed.</p>
      <h2>GitHub</h2>
      <p>GitHub is a place where Git repo's can be viewed easily. GitHub makes it 
        easy to share code or work on projects together with a team, or keep a copy 
        of your personal project on the cloud.</p>
      <h2>Markdown</h2>
      <p>Markdown is plain-text file which gives you formatting options, including bold, 
        italics, headers and more. It is useful for sites like GitHub, where they can be easily viewed.</p>
